Disable horizontal scrolling for Back page in Mac
=================================================

Mac OSX Lion introduces a nasty behavior: when you are scrolling and
the element (or its parents) are no longer scrollable, then horizontal
scrolling with two fingers will trigger back page or next page.

For now this plugin provides a way to prevent that behavior for Chrome
in the case you're scrolling up or left where you can't scroll anymore,
which triggers back/next page.

**UPDATE: Read the blog post I wrote on the subject with alternatives**
[How to handle Mac's broken horizontal scroll](http://micho.biz/mac-osx-lion-horizontal-scroll-event/)
